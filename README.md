--->This is a program that can send multiple emails to a given email address through Gmail or Yahoo.<br>
--->It is written in Python using the SMTP ( Simple mail transfer protocol) library.<br>
--->Note that the maximum number of mails that you can send is 80 at a time , as Gmail does not allow us to send more at a time.<br>
--->You need to change your Privacy settings in Gmail to allow less secure apps to open Gmail and enable IMAP.<br>
